The Modbus RTU presentation gives an overview on the communication protocol. It also includes the requirements as well as basic descriptions of the hardware setup and software implementation.

The Modbus communication project includes two sample programs:
- A simple Modbus RTU communication test
- A program that performs multiple reading and writing operations to control a VAV valve via Modbus RTU
A description of the programs is included in the POUs.

The hardware has to be set up as described in the presentation. The necessary configuration of the terminal is also included there.
